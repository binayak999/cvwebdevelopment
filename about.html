            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                As this is the first assignment of NAMI i am very excited to complete is as soon as possible for this
                design i am inspired by its simple looks with the minimal use of color and i have just inserted the
                color that are pleasent to human eyes.

                After gaining the knowledge about html5 and css3 i am finding web-designing very much exciting. In my
                experience of doing this project i found that knowing html and css3 is not the big deal the concept to
                build website and planing is very important. I was learning the property of css3 but i was confuse where
                to implement the property and how it actually works . So i asked my tutor and he just cleared my problem
                in couple of minutes by showing some examples of wire frames and mock up design by connecting them with
                the html block elements and css properties.
            </p>

            <p>
                And after the concept of material design i was looking forward to implement some examples of it and as i
                was thinking i implemented some of them as well. And when i was searching for the concept of wire frames
                i got to know that before buliding a website there are couple more steps like wire frame design and mock
                up design. So while i started my projects i was blank in mind how to start and after i watched videos
                related to web-designs i started working on wire frames and mock up design as i have listed in my MODAL
                GP page.
            </p>
            <p>
                As in this page i used some concept of material design when you hover my image its looks like its coming
                nearer. By using the property of box-shadow, transition and transform i have created this effect.
