            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This report is all about designing a cv website using html5 and css2/3. By implementing material design
                I have design a very simple webpage. As mentioned in the task I have created total six pages they are
                home page(index.html), about page(about.html), cvpage(cv.html), social page (social.html), modal_gp page
                (modal_gp.html) and finally contact page (contact.html).
            </p>
            <h2>Analysis and design</h2>
            <p>
                To design I followed the simple steps of designing website. First of all, I did work on some wireframes
                for the basic layout of the website. And mock up design to see how my final website would look like. It
                was not a simple task to do those things, so I needed to research a lot about those things first and
                then I watched some videos in YouTube how to design wireframe and how to convert the wireframe into mock
                ups and finally I came up with these results.
            </p>

            <div class="wireframes">
                <div>
                    <h4>Common Section Wireframe:</h4>
                    <p>
                        In all the pages common section of my website were header part and footer part. There are two
                        header designs in my cv website for home page and other common page.
                    </p>
                    <div class="image-section">
                        <h5>Home page header</h5>
                        <img src="images/wireframes/homeheader.png" alt="">

                        <h5>Common Header</h5>
                        <img src="images/wireframes/commonheader.png" alt="">

                        <h5>Footer</h5>
                        <img src="images/wireframes/footer.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4> Home page wire Frame:</h4>


                    After including header and footer common part In home page there are five different section where I
                    have added images and links to them to redirect to their particular page and the basic design layout
                    is created:

                    <img src="images/wireframes/homepage.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>About page wire frame:</h5>

                    <p> In about page the common section of header and footer is repeated I have just used two sections
                        of div where the left one is for my picture and another one is for the about content of the
                        page.</p>


                    <img src="images/wireframes/about.png" alt="">
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h5>CV Page wire frame: </h5>

                    <p>In cv page common section of header and footer is again repeated and then there is also two
                        sections like in about page one containing the one image and another for listing my detail about
                        myself.</p>


                    <img src="images/wireframes/cv.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Modal_GP Page wire frame:</h5>

                    <p>In modal_gp page there is not header and footer section it is just the page of writing the report
                        of this assignment so it's just like pdf page layout.</p>


                    <img src="images/wireframes/module.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Contact Page wire frame:</h5>

                    <p>In contact page common section is again repeated but have two differe section one is for form and
                        another is for google map. </p>


                    <img src="images/wireframes/contact.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Mock up designs:</h5>

                    <p>After being clear about the layouts of my cv website I did so photo shop to create the mock up
                        design so my website. I just use black and white color in my website to make it simple and clean
                        and font that I have use in 'Lato', san-serif. I used some icon from flat icons website and did
                        some modification to use it on my website. And the result for my mockups are as below.


                        After the layout was final then I did some work on findings the proper icons for the homepage
                        and separated five sections and to insert those icons I modified them a little to make it look
                        more familiar to my website.


                        In about page and CV page i have made the image border rounded and used some box shadows to make
                        it more attractive for the visitor to see my website. And when hovering them it will be litter
                        bit bigger and shawdow will be lighter looking like coming near towards us.


                        In social page I have used designs style like square shape and plus rotating them making it look
                        unique and when they are hovered background of the icons will change the color to their
                        originals color and the shape of the icon will be rounded totally.


                        In modal_gp page there is only the simple style like as of pdf files and the images of the
                        screen are placed according to their names and deign in wireframe.


                        In contact page there is no adding changes just has the wireframe layout and same design for the
                        text.


                        After finishing my wireframes and mock up I was now clear about what I am developing using html
                        and css3 properties. After studying the course module I was clear about how to create pages and
                        how to link them together so designing a very simple layout but to make it attractive from html
                        and css I had to learn more css properties so I visited to w3shools which was more than enough
                        for me so I didn't have to struggle more in that.

                    <h2>Validation check for HTML and CSS</h2>
                    <h5>Home Page :</h5>

                    <p>
                        To develop the home page I first of all create index.html page and started make header, main
                        section and footer secton. But the layout I made was litte bit confusing at first for me because
                        the section which needs to be repeat where have 100% with in the screen but the rest content
                        where less than 100% so I just created some classes like "class="fixwidth" having 80% width and
                        I made other divs 100% with and by applying the css property I was able to make the website same
                        like it was looking on the mock ups design earlier. And for the 5 section of linked lcon I have
                        use div naming "child-div" and used the display propertyAnd finishing the home page I validated
                        my home page with the w3 validator online and the screen shot the that validation is down
                        below.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/validation/index.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>About Page:</h5>

                    <p>
                        In about page it was second challenge for me because the header of this page and rest page were
                        different so I got litter stuck in it. But after researching for half an hour I thought to use
                        to
                        inline css in home page to make my logo in the center and comment the whole navigation list and
                        finally the result that I was looking for was done for about page. And for the two section i
                        have
                        used display property. And the validation of the page in down below.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Cv page :</h5>

                    <p>For CV page I have used the same two section but with the listing tag in right div to make it the
                        cv
                        format. No more extra part in done in cv page.
                        And the validation for this page is down below:
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h5>Social Page:</h5>

                    <p>In social page I have used the unordered list tag and anchor tag for link to social page and I
                        also
                        have found the attribute target="_blank" for anchor tag to open the link on the next page. Not
                        in
                        the same webpage. And the validation for this page is down below:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/validation/social.png" alt="">

                        Modal_gp page:
                    </h5>

                    <p>
                        In modal_gp page I have used heading, paragraph tag and image tags to show it simple. And the
                        validation in for this page is down below.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In contact page I have used the form property and iframe property provided by Google Itself to
                        locate my location. And it was done by doing some more research in internets. And the validation
                        in

                    <p>
                        In home page I have used class like fixwidth with the property of 80% width and margin:0 auto to
                        centralize itself. In the five separated div I have use display:flex property and justify
                        content
                        property to make it appear like that

                    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>

                    <p>
                        After completing this whole html and css web-development project I have got knowledge of proper
                        website designing tools. After writing the html markup myself I am being able to find write my
                        mark
                        and css to make I fast and very much understandable. I have used google fonts and font-awesome
                        icons
                        for my website. Font awesome was easier for me to implement in my website rather than using
                        icons
                        images. After watch the video on YouTube about modern web design tool I got to know about font
                        awesome website and after visiting there I found that I can use the fonts like in google so I
                        found
                        the CDN(Content delivery network) code and link it in the head section of html for social page.I
                        have implemented some javascript as well for the navigation bar in responsive view.
                        I researched about java from w3 school as well. I have shown the difference of the code for
                        pages by commenting the not needed code for the specific page.
